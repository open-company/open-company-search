## Background

> There is not a crime, there is not a dodge, there is not a trick, there is not a swindle, there is not a vice which does not live by secrecy.

> -- Joseph Pulitzer

Teams struggle to keep everyone on the same page. People are hyper-connected in the moment with chat and email, but it gets noisy as teams grow, and people miss key information. Everyone needs clear and consistent leadership, and the solution is surprisingly simple and effective - **great leadership updates that build transparency and alignment**.

With that in mind we designed [Carrot](https://carrot.io/), a software-as-a-service application powered by the open source [OpenCompany platform](https://github.com/open-company) and a source-available [web UI](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-web).

With Carrot, important company updates, announcements, stories, and strategic plans create focused, topic-based conversations that keep everyone aligned without interruptions. When information is shared transparently, it inspires trust, new ideas and new levels of stakeholder engagement. Carrot makes it easy for leaders to engage with employees, investors, and customers, creating alignment for everyone.

Transparency expectations are changing. Organizations need to change as well if they are going to attract and retain savvy teams, investors and customers. Just as open source changed the way we build software, transparency changes how we build successful companies with information that is open, interactive, and always accessible. Carrot turns transparency into a competitive advantage.

## Overview

The OpenCompany Search Service handles full-text searching of content in the OpenCompany system. The service uses Elasticsearch for indexing and searching data.


## Local Setup

Prospective users of [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) should get started by going to [Carrot.io](https://carrot.io/). The following local setup is **for developers** wanting to work on the OpenCompany Search Service.

Most of the dependencies are internal, meaning [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) will handle getting them for you. There are a few exceptions:

* [Java](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) - a Java 8+ JRE is needed to run Clojure
* [Leiningen](https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen) 2.9.1+ - Clojure's build and dependency management tool
* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) 6.0+ - Full-text search engine

#### Java

Your system may already have Java 8+ installed. You can verify this with:

```console
java -version
```

If you do not have Java 8+ [download it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) and follow the installation instructions.

An option we recommend is [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/). There are [instructions for Linux](https://openjdk.java.net/install/index.html) and [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) can be used to install OpenJDK on a Mac with:

```
brew update && brew cask install adoptopenjdk8
```

#### Leiningen

Leiningen is easy to install:

1. Download the latest [lein script from the stable branch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/technomancy/leiningen/stable/bin/lein).
1. Place it somewhere that's on your $PATH (`env | grep PATH`). `/usr/local/bin` is a good choice if it is on your PATH.
1. Set it to be executable. `chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/lein`
1. Run it: `lein` This will finish the installation.

Then let Leiningen install the rest of the dependencies:

```console
git clone https://github.com/open-company/open-company-search.git
cd open-company-search
lein deps
```

#### Elasticsearch

This code is used with Elasticsearch 6.x+. The service uses the Elasticsearch's REST API, and only supports IP based access control. The Elasticsearch endpoint and index name are the two configuration options needed.

For local setup see: [Elasticsearch Download and Installation Steps](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch) and use `http://localhost:9200` as your endpoint.

To use the AWS Elasticsearch Service see: [Getting Started with Amazon Easticsearch Service](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticsearch-service/latest/developerguide/)

AWS provides the endpoint you need during the setup process.

#### Elasticsearch local setup (Mac)

Download Elasticsearch from [Elasticsearch Downloads](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch). Unzip it, move it to the place you want to keep it, and run it:

```
./bin/elasticsearch
```

You should be all set.

NB: If it happens that you start the Elasticsearch on machine with low disk space, and you see messages about disk watermark exceeded (low, high or flood_stage) read, you are left with a read-only index (Elasticsearch tries to prevent itself from filling up the remaining disk space). 

For this case only, you can follow these instructions to adjust the disk watermark that Elasticsearch uses:

With this procedure you will lose all your previously indexed Elasticsearch data. Stop the Elasticsearch instance, delete the data directory and restart Elasticsearch with a `./config/elasticsearch.yml` that looks like this:

```
cluster.name: local-es-instance
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low: 4gb
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.high: 2gb
cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.flood_stage: 1gb

network.host: localhost

http.port: 9200
```

You can change the 3 values of disk watermark to make sure they fit your disk space.

#### Required Configuration & Secrets

An [AWS SQS queue](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is used to pass messages from other OpenCompany services to the search service. Setup an SQS Queue and key/secret/endpoint access to the queue using the AWS Web Console or API.

Make sure you update the section in `project.clj` that looks like this to contain your actual JWT and AWS SQS secrets:

```clojure
:dev [:qa {
  :env ^:replace {
    :open-company-auth-passphrase "this_is_a_dev_secret" ; JWT secret
    :aws-access-key-id "CHANGE-ME"
    :aws-secret-access-key "CHANGE-ME"
    :aws-endpoint "us-east-1"
    :aws-sqs-search-index-queue "https://sqs.REGION.amazonaws.com/CHANGE/ME"
    :elastic-search-endpoint "http://localhost:9200" ; "https://ESDOMAIN.us-east-1.es.amazonaws.com/ESDOMAIN"
    :elastic-search-index "CHANGE-ME"
    :intro "true"
    :log-level "debug"
}
```

You can also override these settings with environmental variables in the form of `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, etc. Use environmental variables to provide production secrets when running in production.

You will also need to subscribe the SQS queue to the storage SNS topic. To do this you will need to go to the AWS console and follow these instruction:

Go to the [AWS SQS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and select the search queue configured above. From the 'Queue Actions' drop-down, select 'Subscribe Queue to SNS Topic'. Select the SNS topic you've configured your Storage Service instance to publish to, and click the 'Subscribe' button.

## Usage

Prospective users of [Carrot](https://carrot.io/) should get started by going to [Carrot.io](https://carrot.io/). The following usage is **for developers** wanting to work on the OpenCompany Search Service.

**Make sure you've updated `project.clj` as described above.**

To start a development search service:

```console
lein start
```

Or to start a production search service:

```console
lein start!
```

To clean all compiled files:

```console
lein clean
```

To create a production build run:

```console
lein build
```

## Reindexing

To remove the current search index:

```
curl -i -X DELETE http://localhost:9200/<INDEX-NAME>
```

To reindex, see the [steps in the README](https://github.com/open-company/open-company-storage#force-initial-indexing-or-re-indexing) of the Search Service.

## Testing

Tests are run in continuous integration of the `master` and `mainline` branches on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-search):

[![Build Status](http://img.shields.io/travis/open-company/open-company-search.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/open-company/open-company-search)

To run the tests locally:
